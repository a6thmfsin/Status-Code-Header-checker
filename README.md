# Status-Code-Header-checker
Bash script that curls a list of URLs from a text file and writes out either only status code or status code and headers depending on 
which script you choose. Wrote it due to the problems with httpx lately, also very good to use the status & headers script to search for interesting 
stuff, ex in combination with gf.
